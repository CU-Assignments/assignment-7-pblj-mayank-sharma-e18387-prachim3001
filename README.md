## Problem Statements

### Easy Level:
**Problem Statement:**
Create a Java program to connect to a MySQL database and fetch data from a single table. The program should:
- Use `DriverManager` and `Connection` objects.

- `ProductID`, `ProductName`, `Price`, and `Quantity`.
The program should include:
- Menu-driven options for each operation.
- Transaction handling to ensure data integrity.

### Hard Level:
**Problem Statement:**
Develop a Java application using JDBC and MVC architecture to manage student data. The application should:
- Use a `Student` class as the model with fields like `StudentID`, `Name`, `Department`, and `Marks`.
- Include a database table to store student data.
- Allow the user to perform CRUD operations through a simple menu-driven view.
- Implement database operations in a separate controller class.

## Requirements:
- Java 8 or above
- MySQL Database
- IDE (Eclipse/IntelliJ/VS Code)
